## Overview

This repository is a collection of different machine learning and artificial intelligence projects. It showcases practical implementations of various algorithms and models, including neural networks, search algorithms, classification, regression, and optimization techniques. These projects are designed to solve problems ranging from basic computational tasks to complex real-world problems such as prediction and classification.

## Projects

### Breast Cancer Detection
This project focuses on detecting breast cancer using machine learning models. Various classification techniques, including SVM, decision trees, and Bayesian classifiers, are applied to a breast cancer dataset to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

### A* Algorithm Implementation
An implementation of the A* (A-star) search algorithm, which is used in pathfinding and graph traversal. The project demonstrates its application in finding the shortest path in a grid or map, with an admissible heuristic function.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
This project involves using the Support Vector Machine algorithm for classification tasks. The model is trained on various datasets and tested for its ability to classify data points by maximizing the margin between different classes.

### Regression
In this project, different regression techniques, such as linear and polynomial regression, are implemented to predict continuous values. The model is evaluated on its ability to make accurate predictions based on input features.

### Decision Tree
A decision tree model is built to perform classification tasks. The project demonstrates how decision trees can be used for making decisions based on feature values, with implementations of algorithms like ID3 and CART.

### Bayesian Classifier
This project demonstrates the use of Bayesian inference for classification tasks. The Bayesian classifier is trained and tested on various datasets, showing how prior and posterior probabilities can be used for predictions.

### Perceptron Algorithm
This project includes the implementation of the Perceptron algorithm, a simple machine learning model for binary classification tasks. The model is trained using gradient descent to minimize the error and classify data points.

### DFS and BFS Implementation
This project implements both Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms for graph traversal. These algorithms are applied to solve problems like finding connected components and the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

### 8-Queen Problem
This project solves the 8-queen problem using backtracking. The goal is to place eight queens on a chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

### Future Projects
Stay tuned for more projects and implementations that will be added to this repository in the future!
