This project demonstrates a complete supervised learning pipeline for medical diagnosis using neural networks.
By applying careful data splitting, model tuning, and evaluation strategies, the model effectively learns to classify tumors with high accuracy.
Also forming the foundation for decision support systems in medical imaging and diagnostics.
